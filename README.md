# UniversityManager

This app serves two purposes. Firstly, it's the final project for university "Dabatase applications" classes. But more importantly, I intend to expand my knowledge as .NET dev by greatly exceeding what I am obliged to do. This repo contains API, later I'll create a client to consume it.

Basing on https://github.com/MoienTajik/AspNetCore-Developer-Roadmap I want to learn new tools or/and improve current skills.

## Things I know, but hope to understand even better
* ASP.NET Core
* Entity Framework Core
* SQL Server DB
* REST

## Thinks I used a little, but want to improve
* Dependency Injection (Autofaq)
* Mapping (AutoMapper)
* Testing (xUnit, Moq, FluentAssertions)
* Command pattern (and other design patterns)
* Caching

## New things I want to learn by doing the project
* Docker basics
* CI/CD
* Custom Logging (Serilog)
* Caching
* FluentValidation
* Swashbuckle
* ... and probably much more

## So far I have done

- [x] - created initial project structure
- [x] - initially configured tools like Swashbuckle, AutoMapper, Autofaq etc.
- [x] - created Dockerfiles for project having the project and DB dockerised, created docker compose for easy start (not in repo)
- [x] - connected to DB
- [x] - connected with Travis-CI for automated build and testing
